## YouTube Thumbnail & Shorts Blocker

a browser extension for blocking youtube thumbnails & shorts(in feed & in search results) for a distraction-free browsing.
It blocks the network requests associated with images & thus improves bandwidth.

-   Every time any change is made in the code, you need to reload the extension in developer console to reflect the changes in the browser (don't forget to reload the youtube website-tab)
